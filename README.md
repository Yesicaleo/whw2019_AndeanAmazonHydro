# Project Title: Understanding the diversity of hydrological regimes in the Andean Amazon region

# Collaborators on this Project:
•	Project Lead - Guido Herrera
•	Data Science Lead - Yesica Leon-Tinoco

# The Problem:

The Andean Amazon is a mountainous region with step altitudinal gradient up to 5000 m, where occurs the headwaters of the main tributaries of the Amazon basin. This is a data-scarce region where the understanding of hydrological regimes is a critical factor in the light of water supply, dams planning, and freshwater ecosystem conservation. The evidence suggests that there is a mixture of latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in observed hydrological regimes, however, a large-scale and holistic assessment validating patterns is still missing for this region. 

# Application Example:

This project looks to gain in knowledge on the functioning of freshwater ecosystems in the Andean Amazon region The study of natural hydrological variability and regimes provides a baseline framework to quantify impacts of hydrological alteration in freshwater ecosystems. The projects seek to reveal some insights in the flow-ecology relationships in the Andean Amazon.

# Sample Data  : 

Hydrological data:

- Discharge time series for 1975-2016 from 90 hydrological stations across Ecuador and Brazil
- Annual hydrograms (Only Ecuador) and locations of hydrological stations

Fish data:
- https://www.gbif.org

Data from both countries come from different sources, probably we will need to allocate some time in data cleaning and preparation.

# Specific Objectives/Questions: 
1. Identify key hydrological indicators to describe and classify hydrological regimes in the Andean Amazon.

2. Spatial visualization and mapping of the proposed classification of hydrological regimes to test for latitudinal and altitudinal gradients.

3. Disentangle the importance of topographical and climate variables in explaining the variation in hydrological regimes.

4. Understand the ecological role of hydrological regimes in explaining the diversity of Andean Amazon fishes.
